# Polynomial-Solver
HI! This is a project I made in the middle of my Junior year in High School. The project has a handful of features that gives you information on a polynomial you input. I mainly made this project because I thought that finding the roots of a parabola on a graphing calculator was quite clunky. Additionally you would have to find the roots manually if the parabola's roots were imaginary. This is my third interation of this project; the first made in Snap! and second in Python. This is by far the best of the three since it has much more features than simply returning the roots of a polynomial. Anyway I hope you enjoy the project!

# Usage
- After entering your polynomial in standard form you can chose from the options that will be listed. Just type in the option you want and your result will show

Here are the commands and what they do:
1. roots: returns the the x-intercepts of the input. If the x-intercepts are imaginary, it will plug the input into the quadratic equation and return that
2. table: returns a table of points on the polynomial. It will ask for a starting x-value and an ending x-value which will be its range to look for thecorresponding y-values. It will also ask for the rate at which you want the x-values in the table to increase by.
3. search: returns the y-value of its corresponding x-value.
4. all: returns the tables of all polynomials inputted. This allows you to compare the behaviors and points of different graphs.
5. toString: returns the qualities of the polynomial such as the degree of the polynomial and how many terms it has
6. end: use when you are done with the current polynomial. This allows you to enter another polynomial 

# Limitations
One of the main problems I have with the algorithm is that it only takes in a polynomial in standard form. I think to combat this I can change the inputs to standard form. Additionally, I can add more features such as finding the y-intercept, rearanging the input, and adding a GUI that draws the input on a graph
